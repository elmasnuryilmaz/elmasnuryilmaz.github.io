        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Born on February 14, in Soma, Manisa, Turkey, I am passionate about bioinformatics and molecular biology. Currently, I work extensively with RNA-seq and splicing analyses, using tools like RMATS-turbo and MAJIQ for differential expression and splicing studies. I’m detail-oriented, enjoy organizing my work, and rely on coffee to fuel my productivity!</p>
